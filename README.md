Secret santa pairing app

Rules it follows:
1) Can't pair with yourself (duh)
2) Avoids mutual secret santa (e.g. person a is santa for person b, person b can't be santa for person a)
3) Additional exceptions that can be set, these are two way and meant for use for couples or enemies

Just write your names, set the exceptions and generate your pairings.
You will get links that you send out to your group.

The links themselves use base64 for encryption so that you don't know the pairs if you are participating.
